  3.  If windows authenticated account changed the database state then you will find that account here against User. If the change was made by sql authenticated account then it will show N/A.
      Proceed to next step if it says N/A.
      
  4.  Now we know the spid, timeframe when this change was made. Also, we know the change was made by sql authenticated account. 
      Now, run the below script by changing spid value and starttime to correct value.

  From output you can see that this change was made by use DM\USER123.

  Please note, this step will work only if default trace is enabled and the trace file is still available for the timeframe when database status was changed.

  Additionally, you can follow above steps to check who changed database state to ONLINE, READ-ONLY, etc.
